A hUGEDriver pattern is a series of 64 rows in this format:

  Note     Instr    Effect
NNNNNNNN, IIIIEEEE, XXXXYYYY

where

N = Note code
I = Instrument code
C = Effect code
X = Effect param 1
Y = Effect param 2

If the note code is greater than 71 then it's considered to be an empty note cell.

00 is an empty instrument cell.

000 is an empty effect cell.
