This is a simple example of how to use hUGEDriver with pure SDCC 4.2.0.

Make sure you have both SDCC and RGBDS in your path, then run `make` to build a .gb file which plays some music!

You can run `output.gb` in your favorite Gameboy emulator.

For simplicity reasons this does not use the display, interrupts or allow any user interaction.
