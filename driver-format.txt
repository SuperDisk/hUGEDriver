   Note     instr    effect
0000.0000-0000-0000.0000.0000

Stuff to do:
- Implement routines
- Reloading the wave buffer when Channel 3's instrument changes
- Some form of RLE compression

If note value is greater than 71 then it's considered to be an empty note cell.
Will probably add some sort of RLE encoding later with special notes greater than 71.

00 is an empty instrument cell.

000 is an empty effect cell.
